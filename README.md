# NeonSFF
A 3D Printed Small Form Factor PC Case. Designed in Solidworks.

## Introduction
Born out of a desire for a small yet powerful computer to take with me to college, NeonSFF certainly fits the bill coming at under 6 liters. Comprised of mainly PLA plastic, it is also a cost effective choice not only compared to other small form factor cases, but also to other computer cases in general. After several months of design and prototyping, I feel that the project is complete for my needs. However, I hope others will be able to utilize and modify my design for their own builds as well.

## Getting Started
Unfortunately due to the nature of the project, my design is quite specialized for my choice of components and needs. As a result, you are most likely going to need to modify these files to suit your own specifications (in other words, you need to be familiar with CAD).

### Materials
For starters, you will need to have access to a 3D printer. The larger printbed the better, but not necessary. I printed my case with a print volume of 180mm x 180mm x 150mm by splitting the files into smaller parts. The material I chose was PLA simply because it is very easy to print and cheap. I have not experienced any warping or structural failures even under heavy loads and transportation. However, you could choose to print in other materials such as ABS, PETG, etc.

The only other major components you need for this case are heat-set M3 threaded inserts which you can find [here](https://www.mcmaster.com/threaded-inserts) and M3 screws. These are very nice for 3D printed parts because you can embed it into plastics very easily with something like a soldering iron. Alternatively you could design slots to place M3 nuts into the design.

### My Configuration
